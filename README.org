* abzer

Install abzer as shown [[https://abzer.readthedocs.org/en/latest/setup.html][here]] , run it by either calling =/usr/bin/abzer= or
=python -m abzer=.

Until Read the Docs supports Python 3.5, I'll just dump =--help= here

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
usage: abzer [-h] [-c CONFIG] [-p PROCESSES] [-v] FILENAME [FILENAME ...]

positional arguments:
  FILENAME

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -c CONFIG, --config CONFIG
                        The path to the config file. (default:
                        /home/<username>/.abzsubmit/abzsubmit.conf)
  -p PROCESSES, --processes PROCESSES
                        The number of processes to use for analyzing files.
                        (default: <number of cpus>)
  -v, --verbose         Be more verbose. (default: False)
#+END_EXAMPLE

abzer uses the same config file as the [[https://github.com/MTG/acousticbrainz-client][acousticbrainz-client]] application, but
only uses the =path= option in the =essentia= section. However, it doesn't require a
config file to work, but just uses default values. If those don't work on your
system, you'll be notified of that.
